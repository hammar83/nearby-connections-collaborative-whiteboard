# nearby-connections-collaborative-whiteboard
A simple example of a collaborative whiteboard using [Google Nearby Connections API](https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview).

The application is built to handle a one-to-one connection, but could easily be modified to enable collaboration between several clients. Note that the app isn't thoroughly tested and should only be seen as a starting point/example/test of the Nearby Connections API.
